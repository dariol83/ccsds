CREDITS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eu.dariolucia.ccsds.inspector contains an implementation of a JavaFX axis
chart called InstantAxis. InstantAxis is a derivative work from Christian
Schudt, Diego Cirujano "DateAxis" and Pedro Duque Vieira:
- http://myjavafx.blogspot.com/2013/09/javafx-charts-display-date-values-on.html
- https://www.pixelduke.com/2013/09/06/dateaxis-for-javafx/
- https://github.com/dukke/FXCharts

The authors do not explicitly mention any license but simply the open
source nature of their code: it is fair that they get credits for
what they did, in addition to a very big "thank you".
